##MIRADAS-WORKSHOP

One of the most important changes in Processing 2.1 is that uses the GSVideo library instead of QuickTime. This library is much more convenient than QuickTime. For example solves all the problems we have in our code using QuikTime. Another important change is that works with the updated Minim audio library, this makes the sound composition much easier.

Well, I recommend you in to upgrade to Processing 2.1 asap. and to use the OpenCV library of Greg Borenstein:

or the javacvPro library, that continues of the one we use in the workshop:
