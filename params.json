This library is much more convenient than QuickTime.\r\nFor example solves all the problems we have in our code using QuikTime.\r\nAnother important change is that works with the updated Minim audio library, this makes the sound composition much easier.\r\n\r\nWell, I recommend you in to upgrade to Processing 2.1 asap. and to use the OpenCV library of Greg Borenstein:\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing)\r\n\r\nor the javacvPro library, that continues of the one we use in the workshop:\r\n\r\n[http://www.mon-club-elec.fr/pmwiki_reference_lib_javacvPro/pmwiki.php](http://www.mon-club-elec.fr/pmwiki_reference_lib_javacvPro/pmwiki.php)\r\n\r\n[http://codeanticode.wordpress.com/2011/11/21/opencv-2-in-processing/](http://codeanticode.wordpress.com/2011/11/21/opencv-2-in-processing/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
